438829,2531,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/haucpf/ive_found_a_few_funny_memories_during_lockdown/,regoapps,"Out of curiosity, I went ahead and calculated how much money was spent in Reddit coins for the comment by hand. By June 18th: The 1,707 gifts spent on the comment cost 634,830 coins. That's a maximum of $2,526.62 spent (not including sales tax). This gives the recipient 641 weeks or 12.33 years of Reddit Premium. By June 20th: The 2,478 gifts spent on the comment cost 875,065 coins. That's a maximum of $3,482.76 spent (not including sales tax). This also gives the recipient 142,750 coins to spend and 849 weeks or 16.32 years of Reddit Premium. That amount of gifts bought pays for about 16.01 weeks of Reddit server uptime. Once his Reddit Premium ends, he can spend the coins to get more Reddit Premium: With the coins, he could buy 79 Platinum gifts for 142,200 coins, which gives him 79 more months of Reddit Premium and 700 coins each. He'll end up with a total of 55,850 coins. He can then use that amount to buy 31 more months of Reddit Premium and have 21,750 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 12 more months of Reddit Premium and have 8,550 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 4 more months of Reddit Premium and have 4,150 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 2 more months of Reddit Premium and have 1,950 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 1 more month of Reddit Premium and have 850 coins left over. He can then use that amount to buy 1 more week of Reddit Premium and have 450 coins left over. This gives him 10 years 9 months and 1 week more of Reddit Premium. Combined with the 16.32 years from before, that leaves him with a minimum of 27 years of Reddit Premium.

I‚Äôm posting this from the emergency room and suffice it to say this is not my best day. I really appreciate the smile you gave me. Edit - update as promised further down in the replies to me on here - I got discharged from the emergency room and am home for the night. They did a CT scan, EKG, ultrasound, bloodwork, and urinalysis all within a few hours. I was given strict orders to stay home from work tomorrow, call my doctor, and have them find me the general surgeon who can get me in the fastest to get it biopsied, whatever state or area that may be in (given the covid situation, this could be difficult).  So. Yeah. I have a thread on /r/AskDocs/ with the technical stuff in it, I'm not gonna do that here, but I know some people just need that sense of closure, so. It's gonna be over there shortly. Thank you all for the well wishes. Please keep them coming in whatever way works for you (thoughts, prayers, hopes, dreams, positive vibes - whatever) that I can get this sorted quickly and easily and with a good outcome. Crazy. Didnt' see this coming when I woke up this morning, but by the end if it all, even Rick Astley himself had gilded me and then DM'd me to wish me well.

Not to rain on the parade too much but there are now some really unrealistic expectations with Redditors entering  the stock market. Most still seem to not understand why Gamestop was unique and think that retail will be able to replicate this over and over by just buying shorted stocks.  Gamestop was very, very unique situation though that was only possible because of the generation of synthetic longs. Synthetic longs are not real voting shares, they're generated by buying at-the-money calls and selling an equal number of at-the-money puts. For Gamestop in the last few months, a portion of these synthetic longs become lendable shares as they settle in  lending programs (mutual funds and ETF providers), marginable retail accounts and rehypothicatable hedge fund accounts. That's how Gamestop had a share float of 50.65M and around 65M shares were under short contracts. The demand for short positions exceeded the total float, meaning that synthetic longs from large institutions were being leveraged in short contracts (that's why there was a 120% short/float ratio).  Looking at my terminal, due to the lack of stock borrow supply existing shorts were paying a 32% stock borrow fee and new shorts are paying an over 80% fee. With its low market cap and low volume it really didn't take a lot of purchase power to buy a LOT of cheap call options early on and put enough buy pressure on the market so that the shorts started getting margin calls and had to liquidate at market price once the market day closes. The price went to the moon purely because there was a massive liquidity problem created by these virtual shares.  It will be very hard to replicate these type of squeeze conditions again because synthetic longs generally aren't leveraged for shorts. There is no other stock that has these conditions: https://finviz.com/screener.ashx?v=132&f=sh_avgvol_o500,sh_short_o20&o=-shortinterestshare Way too many are going to enter cluelessly and only end up becoming bagholders and enriching Wall Street.

You have a hard limit on what you walked in with, and that was what you were willing to lose for the chance to play the game.

This is somewhat unique because a significant portion of the stocks in this are coming from some serious ride or die people with a couple hundred bucks to lose for the lulz. That kind of throws a wrench in market predictability so many of the models and assessments they've placed on the stock aren't working as expected. I'm sure they expected it to die after the short ladder on Wednesday. I'm sure they expected it to die after the massive drop on Thursday and people would be panicking and sell out.

They think the longer they do that, the lower our PT will be because we will begin to think the squeeze isn‚Äôt coming. But as the price is üöÄ they are also putting in new shorts (including new people doing the same). rationally, which we know nothing about, it‚Äôs a sound bet at this point, but we hold all the üçå.

Mac thinks voting goes against the will of God, while Dennis is convinced that voting is playing right into the scheme of the big system, and will eventually lead to fascism/theocracy. Charlie decides that he is sick of the bar and thinks it's the perfect time to pursue his dream and become a mailman. He does so but can't figure the job out, so ends up bringing all the mail home.... which ends up being hundereds of ballots. They don't find the ballots until Dee turns Charlie in because she's been hearing about all the delays. When the cops show up to get the ballots from Charlie, they find him passed out from all the drugs he found in the mail, which he decided to take all at once. Meanwhile Frank is busy driving around the state in Dee's car, as fast as he can, going to different ""Count the Vote"" and ""Stop the Counting"" rallies. He thinks sowing discord will be good for his business, but he gets in over his head and somehow ends up naked at a vote count complex In the end, Dee never gets to vote, Charlie goes to jail to sober up, Mac and Dennis end up mad at eachother (again), and Frank gets on national television, naked"

But it never should have been this close - even in the electoral college. Close to 70 million Americans saw a president: - extort foreign countries to smear his opponent -that paid $750 in US taxes, but hundreds in thousands for taxes in foreign countries, and 130k given to strippers - that encouraged violence against protesters and regularly defends killer cops -that mismanaged an epidemic so badly that 300k excess americans died. - that regularly gets laughed at on the world stage - that packed the courts with partisan hacks. - a president that was ok with bounties placed on US soldiers - whose administration had higher turnover than a McDonalds restaurant but wait theres more ! -that was friends with pedophile Jeffrey Epstein and wished Ghislaine Maxwell to do well - that played war games with Iran leading to the deaths of dozens of Canadian citizens  -that kept untold many children in cages, separating them from their families -that broke most of his main promises. No wall that mexico paid for, no resurgence of coal plants, etc -that has a history of racism including spreading conspiracy theories about Obama's birth certificate, calling for the execution of the central park five (black men that were innocent!),  And said...yup I want four more years of that !"

I summoned an uber driver pool deal. My uber driver stopped to pick up the next 2 riders but he couldn't find them. So he barely pulled his car over and said he was gonna walk around the block to see if he could find them. So here I am sitting in the passengers seat of a strangers car thats almost blocking a roadway. Suddenly I hear incessant honking. I look back and its a taxi driver trying to get around the car of my uber driver. More honking. I try to ignore it. But the next thing I know someone (taxi cab driver) is knocking on my uber drivers window screaming, ""move your fucking car!"". I instinctively yelled back, ""it's not my fucking car!"" Im thankful the cab driver just went back and somehow worked his way around us."

It cost almost twice as much as in L.A.per mile. And it would often be faster walking or taking the bus than doing uber pool there with the NYC traffic. Still can be hard finding cabs outside Manhattan. Also cab drivers fret about going to other boroughs.

320889,1158,https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/l6wu59/upvote_so_everyone_sees_we_got_support/,spring_while_I_fall,"A hedge fund works on the principal that the market is complex and requires insane amounts of research and education in financials if you want to make serious money in the market. Basically, just time and money. People that are already rich have the money, what they often don't have is the time to dedicate to studying the market. So they pay a hedge fund to do that. Rich people give a hedge fund large sums of money with the expectation that people working at the fund are smarter than your average Joe and have the time to dedicate to timing the market and helping the 1% make even more money as well as the hedge fund and its employees.  So when a hedge fund makes a stupid, greedy bet in the market, like they have done with GME, they start losing the money of the very wealthy, very influential investors, including financial institutions that lend extra money to the hedge funds. The wealthy are trying to double down and crush us, the little guys and so far they are failing. It's making them very mad and they are trying everything their incredible wealth allows them to stretch the rules or straight up break them and make us ""learn our place"".  Well we're not having it. And I'm not fucking selling. Edit: thanks for the awards and it's your money to spend how you wish but I'd rather see it go towards shares of GME to help send the message that we will not stand for this kind of blatant manipulation and bullying."

If you work for a company that‚Äôs publicly traded, although it might seem like you provide a good or a service to your customers, what you REALLY do is create value for SHAREHOLDERS.   This is true for a c-suite dicksuck or a fry cook.  What they‚Äôre ALL really mad about is that we want a bigger share of the value WE create because unlike 30 years ago, we KNOW where the actual value is being created and where the resultant benefits are being stolen, hoarded, manipulated, etc.  The concept of a 401k was literally THE BANKS and the crooked-ass GOVERNMENT working TOGETHER to build a system that kept OUR MONEY filtering through channels that benefit a bunch of 1% FUCKS before it benefits US.   The irony isn‚Äôt lost on me that ‚ÄúRobinhood‚Äù is named as such, because THEY know we like the idea of GETTING OURS and that‚Äôs how they psychology 101‚Äôd their way into making people think they were on OUR SIDE.

One thing I always wondered was 'But who is benefiting from spreading the ""globe earth lies""?'. Basically they're anti-science because they see science as the removal of god. That's the 'why', an evil plot to explain away God.  If you believe in evolution, then there's no room for god (there is, just not in their view) to have made man in his image. If you believe the earth is round and made through various astronomical processes, then God didn't make earth specially for humans. So Flat Earth etc is them refuting science because they want to believe God did it."

It's all about whether you believe bodily continuity is an important facet of identity. Locke says the thing that makes you you is solely the fact that you have a continuous stream of memories that connect current you to past you. Obviously this brings into play the pretty interesting extreme case to consider of having something like a brain transplant into another body, or dying and moving on to some sort of afterlife. Are you really still you in either of these cases? There's lots of great reading to be done on the subject to help you decide!  Edit: this comment ended up being submitted like four times so I deleted three of them. Never deleted a comment before so I'm not sure exactly what will happen but I thought it was worth a mention"

283999,78,https://old.reddit.com/r/funny/comments/5gn8ru/guardians_of_the_front_page/,DucksOnduckOnDucks,"Great question! Locke's argument here is that while you're sleeping you actually don't exist at all. Obviously what this means is a little confusing, someone can clearly observe you sleeping and even film you sleeping and show you afterwards to prove that you ""existed"" while sleeping. But the concept of what it means for you to exist is a little more complicated than that. Certainly you wouldn't argue that you exist when you're dead because your corpse hasn't completely rotted away. So are you really yourself in a state of non-consciousness like sleeping? It's a difficult idea to wrestle with.  As far as being a new you when you wake up, the memory theory idea of the self says when you wake up as long as you remember being you before you fell asleep you're still the same you, you just weren't you while you were asleep.  If this is something you find interesting I'd recommend reading chapter XXVII of Locke's An Essay Concerning Human Understanding titled: Of Identity and Diversity. Locke's English is a little hard to follow and it's kind of dense but pretty interesting. Memory Theory in some form or another is a really widely accepted identity theory among philosophers but some really great philosophers have other ideas as well. If you're interested in something a little different you could check out David Hume's A Treatise of Human Nature this is a big book and there's a specific chapter I think towards the end that is relevant to identity theory where he essentially argues there is no concrete ""self."" It's worth checking out but I can't recall exactly which chapter it is."

Big corporations can run media and manipulate our thoughts and understanding. This is going on in Canada right now where telecommunications giant Bell has been trying to pass legislation on censoring the Internet.  The big thing r/Canada has found out from awareness groups trying to advocate on this issue is that they have not been able to do any media advertisements on the issue because Bell either runs and owns every radio and tv station and just has so much power that the awareness groups are pretty much blacklisted from traditional media advertisements and are thus silenced

282438,4330,https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/,drkgodess,"They also got a sweetheart deal from Ajit Pai's FCC to continue buying up markets. They are owned by a highly conservative family that wants to create a ""conservative megaphone."" edit: From a NYT article describing the deal:  The Federal Communications Commission on Wednesday announced plans to eliminate decades-old media ownership rules meant to protect local coverage and diversity in media voices. The commission‚Äôs chairman, Ajit Pai, said in a congressional hearing that the agency would vote in November to roll back rules that prevent ownership of a newspaper and broadcast station in the same market. The rules were created to prevent an individual or organization from having outsize influence over public opinion. But in the hearing, where he faced fierce criticism by Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Pai defended the plan and other deregulatory actions in recent months, saying media ownership rules were outdated. They were created 42 years ago, when newspapers and television stations dominated the media landscape, well before Facebook and Google. ‚ÄúThe marketplace today is nothing like it was in 1975,‚Äù Mr. Pai said. It was the latest action by Mr. Pai, who was appointed by President Trump in January, to overhaul the media industry. Since Mr. Pai has taken the top seat at the F.C.C., his deregulatory actions have ushered in the possibility of consolidation in the broadcast television industry. In the spring, soon after he lifted a cap on how many stations a single company can own, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced its intention to buy Tribune Media for $3.9 billion. The merger, which the F.C.C. and the Department of Justice are reviewing, would give Sinclair access to more than 70% of all television viewers in the United States.  It is anti-competitive and anti-democratic for one family to have this much control of local news.  2nd edit: John Oliver's segment about Sinclair Broadcasting"
282438,891,https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/,goof_schmoofer,"Chairman Pai has had a lot of very close conversations with Sinclair...   On November 16, 2016, then-Commissioner Pai traveled to Baltimore, Maryland to have an off-the-record meeting with Sinclair employees and lunch with key company executives.This meeting was not disclosed publicly at the time. In December 2016, J ared Kushner, President Trump‚Äôs son-in law and current Senior White House Advisor, reported that the President‚Äôs campaign had ‚Äústruck a deal‚Äù with Sinclair for better media coverage during the election On January 6, 2017, Commissioner Pai met privately with Sinclair representatives at the Consumer Electronics Show 1n Las Vegas.4 This meeting was also not initially publically disclosed. On January 16, 2017, Commissioner Pai traveled to New York City to meet privately with President-Elect Trump On January 19, 2017, Commissioner Pai traveled to Arlington, Virginia, to meet again with executives from Sinclair.6 A summary of the meeting, Ô¨Åled in the FCC‚Äôs public docket, shows that the agency‚Äôs restrictions on joint or shared-service agreements were discussed in detail On January 22, 2017, President Trump elevated Commissioner Pai to be permanent Chairman of the FCC. On February 3, 2017, pursuant to unilateral direction from the now Chairman Pai, the FCC‚Äôs Media Bureau announced that it would no longer review joint sales agreements and shared- services agreements in broadcast mergers On February 23, 2017, the FCC started a proceeding to allow TV broadcasters to begin using Next Gen TV (also known as ATSC 3.0)‚Äîa technology for which Sinclair holds the key patents On March 6, 2017, Chairman Pai again met with President Trump. Chairman Pai, stated that he and the President did not discuss ‚Äúany pending proceedings‚Äù at the FCC. On April 12, 2017, Chairman Pai led the FCC in a party line vote to ease ownership caps by reinstating the technologically-outdated UHF discount.ll Without this reversal, Sinclair would have been legally barred from merging with Tribune. On April 21, 2017, Sinclair announced its intention to purchase Bonten Media Group (Bonten), owner of 14 television stations in eight markets. Bonten also provided services to four other stations through joint sales agreements. On May 8, 2017 Sinclair announced its intention to acquire Tribune for $3.9 billion. On June 30, 2017, the FCC approved the purchase of seven Bonten stations by Sinclair (Sinclair divested the other seven stations). The transaction was later consummated by the parties on September 5, 2017, at which time Sinclair assumed the joint sales agreements held by Bonten.l4 If the FCC had not relaxed its review of joint sales agreements consistent with Sinclair‚Äôs request, it is unlikely this transaction would have been approved expeditiously without the termination of at least some of the joint sales agreements. On October 24, 2017, Chairman Pai led the FCC (on a party-line vote) in eliminating the broadcast main studio rule. Doing away with the rule, which was established in 1940, beneÔ¨Åts the largest broadcasters, especially Sinclair who has made a pattern of reducing local investments in station studios and consolidating studio and newsgathering operations at its headquarters in Maryland.‚Äù At the upcoming November 16, 2017 FCC Open Meeting, Chairman Pai is expected to lead FCC (on a partisan basis) to take two actions that will directly beneÔ¨Åt Sinclair. Chairman Pai is expected to lead the FCC‚Äôs party-line vote to eliminate decades-long rules that prevent TV stations in the same market from merging if the outcome leads to fewer than eight independent stations operating in that market, or if the merger is between two of the top four stations in a market.[6 This rule change directly beneÔ¨Åts the monopoly aspirations of Sinclair by eliminating the need for it to divest any of the stations it is purchasing from Tribune.' At the same meeting, Chairman Pai also is expected to lead the FCC (on a party-line vote) to approve broadcaster‚Äôs use of Next Gen TV. The item that Chairman Pai has put forth for vote would directly beneÔ¨Åt Sinclair. First, the draft order would establish a licensing framework for broadcasters that would allow Sinclair to establish and   Your investigation should, at a minimum, examine the following questions:  Whether the totality of the Chairman‚Äôs actions with regard to media ownership policies, media concentration policies, or the Sinclair- Tribune transaction, demonstrate actual impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality? Whether the totality of the Chairman‚Äô actions with regard to media ownership policies, media concentration policies, or the Sinclair-Tribune transaction demonstrate the appearance of impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality? Whether the Chairman‚Äôs actions create the appearance or demonstrate the actual lack of independence of the FCC? Whether Chairman Pai‚Äôs actual impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality requires that he recuse himself from all matters that would materially impact Sinclair or media ownership and media concentration matters? Whether the appearance of Chairman Pai‚Äôs impropriety, unscrupulous behavior, favoritism towards Sinclair, or a lack of impartiality requires that he recuse himself from all matters that would materially impact Sinclair or any media ownership and media concentration matters? Whether the FCC‚Äôs consideration of the Next Generation TV matters has been unduly inÔ¨Çuenced by the Chairman‚Äôs desire to boost the business interests of Sinclair? Please include in your answer whether the FCC‚Äôs examination of this matter has appropriately taken into account the competition and anti-trust issues raised by Sinclair‚Äôs role as the sole patent holder of key components of the Advanced Television Systems Committee 3.0 (ATSC 3.0) technology.   The draft order under consideration will not require Sinclair to offer, to other broadcasters, access to its patented ATSC 3.0 technology on a reasonable and nondiscriminatory basis. https://www.fcc.gov/document/next-generation-broadcast-television-standard. source"

282438,571,https://old.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/88ll08/this_is_what_happens_when_one_company_owns_dozens/,goeasyonmitch,"That's not what that ranking is talking about at all. Their main issues seem to be with Trump's rhetoric against the MSM and Obama's prosecution of whistleblowers. From their website:  US press freedom, enshrined in the First Amendment to the 1787 constitution, has encountered several major obstacles over the past few years, most recently with the election of President Donald Trump. He has declared the press an ‚Äúenemy of the American people‚Äù in a series of verbal attacks toward journalists, while attempting to block White House access to multiple media outlets in retaliation for critical reporting. Despite the bleak outlook under Trump, it bears repeating that his predecessor left behind a flimsy legacy for press freedom and access to information. Journalists continue to be arrested for covering various protests around the country, with several currently facing criminal charges. The Obama administration waged a war on whistleblowers who leaked information about its activities, leading to the prosecution of more leakers than any previous administration combined. To this day, American journalists are still not protected by a federal ‚Äúshield law‚Äù guaranteeing their right to protect their sources and other confidential work-related information. And over the past few years, there has been an increase in prolonged searches of journalists and their devices at the US border, with some foreign journalists being prevented from any travel to the US after they covered sensitive topics such as Colombia's FARC or Kurdistan."

These people will literally read whatever is on the teleprompter, and it's the same script. I hate to say it, but I think it's time to break up Sinclair Broadcasting or any other broadcast network of similar scope, because this kind of consolidation in media outlets is truly dangerous, and they're becoming too good at circumventing laws that are meant to limit it. Unsurprisingly, Ajit Pai at the FCC has expressed a wish to deregulate media ownership rules, meaning it's set to do the opposite and to get worse.  We are witnessing an ever-expanding takeover of local media organizations. I'd say this is extremely dangerous to our democracy, but I think that's been said enough.  :-)"

It was an ascent program for bad kids. In the middle of this trek, the leaders split us up for 3 days. We had a bag of food consisting of sweet grains and a few pieces of candy, approximately 800 calories. We had unlimited drinking water, 1 bottle and fluoride tabs. We were given a sheet of plastic and 10 feet of twine. We had to setup our own camps and survive alone for 3 days. The first day was frantic, setting a base, making my shelter, ridding insects and clutter to keep away bugs and things that bite. As dusk arises, so does the anxiety. The wildlife is in full roar, to the point that you can't hear your thoughts over the wild birds singing their songs. As the night progressed, and the temperatures dropped, so did the songs of the birds. As it seemed, suddenly the woods were black, pitch black, and nothing could be heard. You could only hear your own heartbeat. I longed for family, comfort. I feel asleep thinking I'd never wake again. SNAP! I'm sitting up, still, holding my breath. SNAP! My eyes are wide, trying to visualize what's near and might possibly be my demise. SNAP! I jump and grab the thing closest to me, a boot. Great. I'm shaking and hysterical. I want to shit. Snap.. the breaking branches are getting softer, its moving away.  It goes quiet. I have a headlamp, batteries so far gone all I get is a dim glow. I decide to turn it on to check the time on my cheap casio. I'm laying down again and I turn my lamp on. FUCKING FROG IN MY FACE! I screamed like girl in a cheap horror movie. The frog stayed in place. Hes sitting out of the weather in my other boot that was tipped over. This frog came back to my boot for the next 2 nights, and slept in my boot right next to my face.

Thank you RK for your initial thesis, and for putting in the work to present a golden DD that showcases the reality of business and big finance in the US and around the world. Why should only big money decide who gets to live and who goes down under? I'm in this company because I believe in its status as a symbol of a modern age story of change, adaptation, innovation and community or grass-roots backed financing. If it weren't for Tesla and the people who believed in it, when all the big hedge funds were trying for years to put it down under, who knows where we would've been today in EV tech and industry. GME, for better or worse, is waking people up to the realization that we, as individuals, still possess the same power as we always have: the power to unite, collaborate and structure ourselves around ideas in order to bring them to reality. People are starting to realize that not only can they affect change in their societies by the power of their vote, but they can also do it by the power of their wallet, regardless of its weight. Same as in social activism, financial activism relies on organizing ourselves, in chasing reform and change that has positive impact on our local and global communities alike. Wealth inequality needs to be tackled at all levels of society, not just by policy. The system is wide and far-reaching and we must use everything available to us so that we may carve the life we want for ourselves and our children. GME is a good company, with a solid investment thesis and more importantly, the potential to transition into something that our generation of gamers sorely needs. There is real potential here, why should they go bankrupt just because a handful of suits decided it's in their own best financial interest? Save and transform! Enough killing and profiting off of it. I'm sending a message, as I know you all are. This will be heard and this will have an impact. Never stop believing this. Remember, change is a long game of attrition which will be won only by those who will endure its tides. I am not selling! Fired up and ready to fucking go!"

Later on that year his father died and shortly after he found out his wife was having an affair with the vice principal.  He ended up shooting himself and I was heartbroken.  I still remember the last time I saw him and he asked how my calc was - I was still flunking it but since he had made such an effort I lied and said my grades had turned around."

I pay a shit load of taxes to have my kids well educated and I don't want them to be handicapped to meet some arbitrary common ground.

About 30 min before the class started we asked another teacher to unlock the classroom and we set up in there, 5 minutes before class started he unlocked the door and we all yelled happy birthday! He was really happy and instead of doing the actual things he had planned we all ate our cake and played different party games together, it was our last year at that school so we wanted to make it a bit special for him.

But most MMOs want you to do every raid like 5 or 10 times to gear up for the next one and its just way too much work. In most cases I would say the games are better experienced watching someone else do all the work for you."

It is fine for the DM to fudge the rolls here and there in secret for the story (how often and when is a complicated personal matter).

It's pretty simple to understand, it's just not comfortable:  Cheap Chinese slave labor makes products less expensive. This makes products have higher profit margins while maintaining relatively low prices. The average person gets creature comforts at affordable prices, the rich get massive profit margins, and the politicians get a distraction from their own misdeeds because ""Well look what they're doing""  Nobody is doing anything about it because nobody WANTS to do anything (meaningful) about it.  Oh I can't stop buying Chinese products says the consumer, the manufacturer should stop making them. Oh I can't stop making them says the manufacturer, the consumer is unwilling to pay higher prices. Oh I can't do anything says the politician, trade sanctions would upset both the consumer and manufacturer.  Everyone wants someone else to do something about it, nobody wants to actually do it. Edit: Want me to prove it? You're doing it right now. Reddit Inc is owned, in part, by Tencent. Which is basically a shell company for the CCP to infiltrate influence invest in western companies and back flow profits. Edit 2: Why my comment is hidden. Reddit has a feature called crowd control. It's in beta and still clunky. Because I am not actually subscribed to r/gifs, my comment is auto-hidden. I like r/gifs I just prefer to visit it dedicated instead of haivng it sprinked into my feed. This is something the mods choose to implement, in part at least, and it can be very useful. I use it on the subs I mod.  That said it is not without flaws. IMO the problem is it's a slider, and not a series of tick boxes. There's A, B, and C. But the only options are:  A A&B A&B&C  You can't do just B or A&C but !B. Poorly implemented imo. So if they want to crowd control out criteria C, they ALSO need to do A&B. It's nothing nefarious."

Stepping into its 'internal affairs' is crossing boundaries and breaking sovereignty of a state. (Look at DPRK. Notorious...but nothing gets done to them either) This is ethnic cleansing. The kind that has been seen before, and will continue. But with current international law and politics don't have much say in it because 1) international law is not enforced. There is no governing body, military or anything in fact. It's only a 'customary' to keep international law, many of them in form of treaty.  I mean institution like ICJ exist, but often times the ruling takes years to conclude, and it's judgement questioned especially it's judges are selected by states of power (or was)...but that's another matter. 2) sovereignty of a state is a thing. When that is broken down, for any reason, leaves a bad precedent.  3) Also, as with both of aboves in mind, who is to decide what gets judged in the eyes of international law/court and who isn't?  It is not they don't do anything. They can't. The worst UN can do is enforce some 'sanctions'. Yeah, this does some damage to backwards states like DPRK, but when our international trades are so interweaven (such as in the case with China) it hurts us, as well as China. Don't forget, most of the Europe and the US didt give a toss about Jews in Nazi Germany. They didn't do shit then. Also ethnic cleansing in Nazi Germany wasn't just Jews but also various factions of both religious and politics too.

The Xinjiang region is very important to china‚Äôs ‚ÄúOne belt, one road‚Äù initiative and is rich in oil and cotton resources.  About half of the region‚Äôs population is Uyghur (8m/19m). The Uyghurs are predominantly Sunni Muslim, and over the last decade the Salafi ideology (think Al-Qaeda and ISIL) and militant Islam has grown a lot.  There have been numerous terrorist attacks in Xinjiang, though the CCP does its best to cover them up. Thousands of Uyghurs have left Xinjiang to fight in Syria under the Turkistan Islamic Party, which worked closely with ISIS and Jabhat al-Nusra. They‚Äôre very very bad guys.  China is concerned because Xinjiang has all the ingredients of an Islamist uprising: Salafism, weapons, and a history of oppression. Any sort of uprising or separatist movement in Xinjiang would do serious damage to China‚Äôs Belt/Road initiative and the Chinese economy in general, and it could spark similar uprisings in other Chinese territories.  Their main goal is to not only ‚Äúderadicalize‚Äù the salafists but to erode the essence of religion in general. Thereby stopping the growth of Salafism and maintaining Xinjiang‚Äôs status as part of China.  Btw, I‚Äôm not in any way defending China‚Äôs actions here.

(This is kinda important in Asia I believe. Weird, I know...) Japan is for people from Japan, Korea is for Koreans, etc etc. But how do you define 'Chinese' when you don't have a singular ethnicity? Well normally culture, language and/or religion helps. Thing is China has variety of those as well. So way back when they wanted this 'unified' China against all those imperialists, capitalist, foreign interventions etc etc they pushed this idea that China is one nation..and Chinese as people who live on the land (not by their actual history or culture etc) Then the problem with the USSR collapse and several smaller states becoming independent. So what would happen to 'China' if all these ethnic minorities wanted independence like former USSR satellite states? Well, since 'Chinese' is people livining in 'China', they justified the government with twisted history (there's whole different practices of china altering/destroying historical sites/relics) to say every one of these ethnicity was 'part of China' at one point or other in its history. To put it simply, rather than to actually unifiy it's ethnicity voluntarily they brainwash and/or use force. Like in this post This is just one of those things that happen. Look up Tibet. Not much different. People have been voicing their concerns literally for decades. (Free Tibet). Similar shit happened between China and  (South )Korea and there was tension back few years ago (iirc that's when Trump visited China). All to justify the Chinese government rule..and to stomp out ant movement for independence.

I'm aware of Japanese minority. Im aware that Japanese gov has been promoting themselves as homogenous at least till 80's.

I have an auto subscription for TP made from recycled bamboo and the company takes half of their profit and donates toilets to countries in need (Who Gives A Crap TP). They just donated over 5 million dollars to different charities. I go out of my way to buy from my local farmers market every Saturday and support neighborhood grocery stores that aren't big chains. I just adopted a cat and realized that Nestle and other big companies manufacture fucking everything even cat litter and the most popular pet food brands so I triple check labels and do a quick Google search to see who manufactures the product before buying ANYTHING.  Little changes like this aren't that hard to adapt to and it feels good to know where my stuff is coming from and know that I'm supporting ethical companies"

Which is not to say they aren't a good company, but most of the bulk online TP companies are Chinese-made (How We Roll, Greencane, etc). Given that this thread is specifically talking about products not made in China, though, it seems relevant. Not only do they outsource to chinese manufacturing, they say they are proud to do so. Take that as you will. See this link to their FAQ that confirms it.  We're an Australian-owned company, and after a lot (and we mean A LOT) of thoughtful consideration, we‚Äôve proudly set up our manufacturing operations in China. There‚Äôs a bit of a misconception about production in China, which we think is important to address. We work closely with our producers to ensure standards and processes we‚Äôre happy with, plus we found that China offered a lot of wonderful benefits."

Who in the right mind will oppose a market that every western corps rely on? a 1.5 BILLION population market, just each year one of them just buy ONE coke, that will bring billions and trillion to coke cola, now all they need to say is I will shut down any business if you threaten our politics because we are communist, which happened many times already. Last year they threaten to shut down any airline that show taiwan's flag and force every airline to change taiwan to China,Taipei (yes, even little stupid thing like this). In the end, every airlines complied, even United airlines and american airline. Why do you think Taiwan is still out of WHO? nations can't even post their flag on their airline website, can't join olympic with their national flag. It's been going on like this for a very long long time. You don't need a physical invasion when you already claim a country is yours, their name, flag, participation in any international events are not allowed. Democracy+Capitalism can win pure communist, but they can never win a fully evolved Communist + part Capitalism. In the end, it's all about money and power, and they get money plus one unify power."

Your post is technically correct: A lit cigarette placed in a pool of liquid gasoline will most likely go out. For gasoline to be explosive, air must have between 1.2% and 7.1% gasoline vapors. Less than that, and there isn't enough gasoline to burn. More than that, and there isn't enough oxygen. Most parts of a gas station will be perfectly safe to light up a cigarette and smoke, because there is not a dangerous concentration of gasoline in the air. But the dangerous concentration is possible. In fact, if you stopped time and sampled everywhere around each fuel pump, you will probably find a couple spots that do have an explosive level of gasoline in the air. That is the danger. Lighting up at a pump is a risk I would never personally take."

The FCC governs ISPs but not apps because ISPs are utilities with a regulated infrastructure such as underground cables, above ground land lines, satellites, cell towers, wifi bandwidth, etc.  This bill simply treats ISPs as equivalent to Facebook or Youtube. Having said that all that, and being a staunch conservative I must say that the Republicans fucked this one up....please call your congressman and demand that this bill be rejected, it is a violation of our 4th Amendment.  Utilities are subject to a different standard than apps.  imho."

Now, with the way that the Senate rules work not voting effectively means ""whatever everyone else decides"" (regardless of the symbolic gesture that is that outcome, and changing that would require a rules change which is unlikely right now). So effectively, every single Republican senator quite literally sold part of the privacy of every American Citizen, resident, and visitor. Meanwhile every single Democrat and Independent voted against giving the companies more power to invade and control lives.  If we, as a country allow the corporations to take full control of the avenues of information, manipulation of the voting public is trivial, and nearly certain. This is not an immature ""companies are evil"" rhetoric, but the reality of self-interest by corporations, and the importance of the free unaltered flow of facts, reality, and discourse.

It really should be apparent to anyone paying attention that the two parties are NOT the same. The Democrats are much better when it comes to trying to protect the public interest. The Republicans are all about protecting big business -- but they manage to cloak that agenda in a push for a more ""free market"" that is against ""big government."" The problem is that the Republicans don't push for any policies that would help the middle class, small businesses, fairer competition. In failing to do this, they effectively push us closer oligarchy (and this is not an exaggeration at this point as some studies suggest that by standard measures for the kind of economic structure that makes a country an oligarchy, the US is already an oligarchy). What people need to somehow understand is that the playing field in our private markets has become tilted too far in favor of giant corporations, and the only antidote to this is at least modest increases in government regulations aimed at creating a more competitive playing field. It is simply anti-American and anti-democracy to allow the playing field to be as skewed as it is today."

He opined that he doesn't like monopolies, but that he hates monopolies granted government protection more:  Het neutrality advocates fear that without FCC regulation, digital monopolies will develop, as big companies charge for Internet access. Paul said, ""I don't like monopolies, but I also don't like monopolies where the government gives the monopoly. For example, in many cities, there's a virtual monopoly on cable."" He pointed out, ""I think if there's evidence that someone has a monopoly, let's take away government privilege that creates the monopoly.""   There's a principled argument to be made here from a small government/Libertarian perspective, but I think it misses the forest for the trees: allowing any entity control of data effectively stems the flow of that data, full stop. There need be some rule, somewhere, that effectively disallows the government and private enterprise from interfering with digital transmission, and FCC's implemented Net Neutrality rules are/were a decent stopgap, if a moderately dangerous precedent to set for governmental regulation. Without some legislation that amounts to essentially one line that says ""No one may mess with the internet"", rolling back current protections leave consumers vulnerable to the whims of ISP monopolies."
258407,215,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/61ns2w/private_internet_access_a_vpn_provider_takes_out/,nemo_nemo_,"I get what he's saying, and I actually agree with him in principle. But you're absolutely correct, he's missing the point here. This is a unique situation because the cost of establishing new infrastructure in this sector is prohibitively high. Google tried it with Fiber, but they had to stop because the costs were too high to be profitable. So as it stands, any decent coverage would have to go through the same landlines the cable companies are using. Also, it's certainly worth noting that Time Warner and Comcast didn't install these lines themselves. They were built by tax payer money. So it's not like either of those horrible, shitty companies actually earned their current monopolies; they were handed it when the internet was young and no one knew what it would become. So what we have is a situation where, as far as I can see it, it's actually nearly impossible to be competitive as a start up ISP.  I mean, if Google can't do it, then no one can.  I live in a city and have two options: Time Warner or Windstream. I tried Windstream once, it was pretty shit tbh, and I had to switch back to Time Warner. Anyone not living in a city doesn't even have this option, it's either Time Warner or Comcast. This is all frustrating, especially because I'm from KY.  And while I don't consider myself conservative, I voted for Paul because I believe in a healthy balance of opinions in Congress, and because he struck me as someone with integrity and intelligence. By sponsoring this bill, it shows me that either he got payed off by the ISPs and he doesn't have integrity, or that he doesn't see the reality of the situation that I just described and therefore he lacks intelligence.  You can be libertarian and anti-regulation all you want, but call a spade a spade and realize that there is zero competition in this sector, and that that inevitably hurts the American people. Couple that with the fact that this particular regulation they overturned was about protecting privacy, and it makes even less sense from a libertarian perspective."

Not shitting you EDIT: Since this comment blew up let me clarify a few things.  I was just commenting from what I remember. I had not reviewed this case by any means and just recalling what I heard around the trial. Its been a few years so I was incorrect in assuming that they were not shown the shooting after the judge ordered the release of an edited version. However that edited version was just the public release at the time. The jury was shown ""Minutes of the footage that include Shaver being shot."" I do not try to spread misinformation. I just did not review the case before I made an off hand comment, I apologize. I try to make it a point to correct things I say that are incorrect, and explain why I said it.  The following is a Courthouse Papers breakdown of how and why the footage was not released to the public unedited in 2016.  """"Earlier Thursday, Maricopa County Superior Judge George Foster granted a motion filed by the defense to prevent the media from recording the body-cam footage shown to the jury after hearing arguments on the matter Wednesday. Judge Sam Myers, who was previously assigned to the case, issued an order in 2016 to release the footage only in part.

So once upon a time when I was a wee young lad of about 14, my father had gifted me a dirt bike. Now for some background, my family was very poor. My dad had done some work for this guy on the side and this gentleman had gave us this dirt bike because he had no use for it, we would never be able to afford it otherwise. We went camping a few weeks later and when we returned we found the house burglarized, my PS2 stolen as well as my dirt bike. Hastily we made a police report expecting nothing to be done. A week goes by and by some miracle the police had found my dirt bike! Great! I exclaimed, but its Thursday, we won't be able to pick it up until tomorrow. The officer assured us that it would be fine. The next day we arrive at the police lot and I am greater by the sound of my dirt bike being ran in the lot behind. The officer had brought his kids to the lot to ride the dirt bike. A bit annoyed, but ok no harm no foul. Thats when my dad was informed that he would have to charge him 2k dollars for all the ""fees"" associated with the return if the dirt bike. My dad, not having that kind of money, asked for any other options. The officer told us that we could wait for police auction to try and get it back or pay the fee. Well the auction wasn't for a month, so my dad desperately tried to scrounge the money up. 1 day later my dad had the money (with additional for the extra day of storage) and he went to get the dirt bike back. The officer we had been speaking to the day before had indicated on the paperwork that we had, ""given up the rights"" to the dirt bike and the officer was allowed to purchase the dirt bike before the auction, my dirt bike had already been sold for a few hundred dollars. And thats the story about how my dirt bike was stolen and then stolen again by police. We never got that dirt bike back and no we didn't sue as it would have been a lengthy expensive hassle. Goodjob officer dick weed, you stole a 14 year olds dirt bike."

The pension he's receiving could amount to ~$1.8 million over the course of his lifetime. That's free income he's getting for being terrible at his job.

At best it seems that with so many officers it seems like the primary officer should have had a taser, with a secondary officer having a pistol. Since they were already out of the room, it seems that laying still and approaching them to apply handcuffs would have been pretty straight forward."

If you lived on 23.5 N and the phenomenon in the photo only occurred on the summer solstice, then it would only be experienced there once a year.  Similarly for 23.5 on the winter solstice.  Anywhere in the middle, and you would experience it twice a year.   That said, if the phenomenon occurred on either solstice anywhere, it would only occur that one time of a year there, and twice if it occurred any other day in between.  The 23.5 component doesn't change that."

250398,82,https://old.reddit.com/r/pics/comments/6z699p/my_dad_waits_every_year_for_the_day_the_sun_rises/,TheLittleGoodWolf,"I don't know about the legality of taking shots at a crossing but I would still heavily want to emphasize the security issue. Hundreds of people die from being hit by trains every year and while I can't really find any stats to how many of these are photography related there are plenty of reports where they are. Train tracks are seriously dangerous for many reasons, first off the train is much wider than the tracks themselves creating an illusion of safety, second of all trains are fast, really fast, so fast that if you are on the tracks once you hear the train it's too late. Thirdly all it takes is for the train to graze you to cause serious injury. I know personally that once you are behind the camera the world around you sort of vanishes which makes taking photos on the train tracks even more dangerous. Unless he's at a crossing that signals before a train comes the crossing is no more safe than anywhere else on the tracks, and you can't be sure that the signal won't malfunction either. in 2016 over 250 people were killed by trains but 798 people were injured. There are tons of PSAs from both railroad companies and photography sites telling people to please not shoot on the tracks. Lastly it's not only the people who are hit by the trains that are affected, nobody really ever thinks about the people driving the trains or the people who have to scrape of the remains of what once was somebody's child or parent or partner from the train. An 8 car passenger train traveling at 80 miles per hour needs about a mile to stop once the emergency brakes are applied. The average freight train traveling at 55 miles per hour usually needs more than a mile to stop. In 2011 in the United States 365 people were killed while trespassing on railroad right-of-way and property. This is not a trivial matter, please be safe."

Except while rails may have less traffic trains are faster, make surprisingly little sound when you are in front of it, they are much wider than the tracks themselves, they cannot swerve and most trains need a mile in order to come to a full stop once the emergency brakes are applied. The biggest reason for why rails are so dangerous is that people think they are safer than they are, they think they'll hear the train which is false because the sound mostly follows the train itself, once you hear the sound it's usually too late."

In the old days, we'd storm the Bastille and cut the head off the king. We've (thankfully) moved onto more progressive ways of dealing with corruption, but it's still everywhere. This is OUR French Revolution. This is OUR American revolution. The serfs are fed the fuck up, and you, u/DeepFuckingValue, you rallied us around the flag of GME. It's been an ugly, unfair fight, but together, we're un-fucking-stoppable. Hold the line, you beautiful fucks. Edit: Shoutout to the Europeans and Asians and anyone else in the world who's in on this too. We know you're pushing just as hard as anyone!"

Turning this channel up on your sound system should help with this problem. Unfortunately I can't help you as far as which channel to turn up, how much, etc. since I haven't taken Digital Audio yet, but if it makes you feel any better, in a year when this is reposted I should be able to help out the next guy a little more. :)"

Put some that your feelings would be hurt without into one. Keep those, knowing it's okay to keep truly treasured possessions. Then choose some whose feelings you think would be hurt more by being held in captivity by someone who doesn't love them as much, than they would be hurt by being chosen for a new home. Donate those after wishing them well.   The stuffies who are not in good enough repair for second life and are no longer bringing you happiness have thus served valiantly, so they can now be retired to a cardboard box lined with tissue paper, on a ""farm"" (placed gently in the trash).

One day we went to McDonald's, which was a big deal for me, because my parents didn't want me to eat fast food. Anyway, they had a Happy Meal with all the important characters from the film and of course I had to have Buzz Lightyear. For a while he became my favourite ever toy in the world, because I was absolutely certain that he was different from my other toys. Unlike the others, he was definitely a sentient being with his own hopes and aspirations. In my mind, he regularly went on adventures in my room, which seemed all the more likely because my mother secretly moved him around my room while I slept. I would go as far as marking where I put him down last with a pencil to ""make it harder"" for him to keep his nightly activities go unnoticed.  Sure enough, my mother noticed my meticulousness and adapted the way she would move him during the night. For example, she would simply turn him around by 180 degrees to make it seem like he was getting sloppy etc. I'm glad to see that the magic of Toy Story is still going strong even amongst the youngest generation. Happy for you, and glad that I could share my own story."

I, too, used to peek around my door to see if my toys came to life but more in terror than wonder. Lol"
